  "pattern_name": "Absent Field",
  "pattern_description": "Protocol messages have mandatory information elements (fields) defined by specification. The code directly dereferences the corresponding element without first checking that the mandatory element is actually present, appears the required number of times, and satisfies any conditional 'mandatory if X' rules. (2) An element whose header and length are syntactically valid does not actually carry the mandatory field values required by the protocol specification. These unchecked accesses can lead to null pointer dereferences, out-of-bounds indexing on empty lists, leading to DoS or other security impact."
